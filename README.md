Password Generator

##Description:

The aim of this project was to create a random password generator using JavaScript.

##Lessons learnt:
- Create a series of prompts within a while loop
- The difference between for and while loops and the purpose of each
- Identified weak areas that need improvement e.g. accessing local variables from outside

##Usage:

Click on the "password generator" button to display prompt for password length, which is required to be within the range of 10-64. If the password length is within the range specified, then a series of prompts will be displayed asking about the character types to include in the password. At least one character type is required for the password to be generated. The password generated will appear within the password box.
